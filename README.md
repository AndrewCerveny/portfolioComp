## Project title/ Assaignment given/ approx time spent on build
A static Composition: We were given a spec with two examples and I choose the one with more grpahs and widgets. The assaignment is https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html

## Motivation
As someone who recently did the other spec in a seperate repository (ForegedInFire) I challenged myself to try to do this other option.

## challenges 
Limited time we got this assaignment on Tuesday 12/13 and it was due 12/16. Also I haven't had to collect so many SVGs before, so I created an html file to organize them. I also have rarely used css position fixed and relative. The expansion of the page may alter the strucutre but to get things layedOut i used these techniques. I also tried to implement css grid but the documentation was dense and I had a hard time figuring out how it would apply. I need mentorship for CSS grid and more time to understand it's features.
